# 💼 Inview Club Cases 💼

## 👉 What's this?

Problems, tasks, and ideas we have encountered through our experience working as DevOps engineers.

All our cases can be implemented locally, requiring only time and the ability to google. They will serve as good practice for your resumes and knowledge and can be useful for talking about yourself in interviews.
